            <h2>What Is a Technical Accounting Memo?</h2>
            <p>
              A technical accounting memo is a formal document prepared by a company's finance or accounting team to analyze and document the rationale behind significant accounting decisions. These typically include judgments around complex areas like:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Revenue recognition (ASC 606)</li>
              <li>Lease accounting (ASC 842)</li>
              <li>Business combinations (ASC 805)</li>
              <li>Impairment assessments</li>
              <li>Debt vs. equity classification</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              The memo outlines the relevant facts, references applicable accounting standards (usually U.S. GAAP or IFRS), explores alternative treatments, and clearly states the company's chosen approach - all backed by authoritative guidance.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Do These Memos Matter?</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Audit Defense</h3>
            <p>
              Auditors love documentation. A well-written memo demonstrates that management performed a thorough analysis and applied professional judgment. It helps reduce back-and-forth during audits and provides support that your accounting positions are defensible.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Regulatory Compliance</h3>
            <p>
              Public and private companies alike are held to rigorous standards. Technical memos show regulators (and internal stakeholders) that your company is following the rules - and that your accounting isn't based on guesswork or outdated interpretations.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Consistency Over Time</h3>
            <p>
              Accounting positions often span multiple periods. Documenting your rationale now ensures continuity and prevents knowledge loss if team members change. When you revisit an issue next quarter or next year, the memo becomes a crucial reference point.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Stakeholder Confidence</h3>
            <p>
              Whether it's investors, auditors, board members, or potential acquirers, stakeholders want to know your financials are grounded in solid, professional analysis. Well-prepared technical memos help build that confidence.
            </p>

            <h2>The Problem: Writing These Memos Is a Drag</h2>
            <p>
              Despite their importance, technical memos are time-consuming and often get pushed to the back burner. They require deep technical knowledge, careful wording, and meticulous formatting. In fast-paced finance teams, it's easy to fall behind - or worse, skip them altogether.
            </p>

            <h2>The Solution: AI-Powered, CPA-Approved</h2>
            <p>
              That's where Gaapio comes in.

            </p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
